This Python-based alarm clock uses Tkinter for a user-friendly GUI, allowing users to set alarms with dropdown menus. A background thread continuously checks the system time and plays an alert sound when it matches the set alarm time. The program utilizes datetime, time, threading, and Winsound to ensure smooth functionality. Multithreading keeps the interface responsive while the alarm runs in the background. Potential improvements include a stop button, multiple alarms, and custom sound selection.
